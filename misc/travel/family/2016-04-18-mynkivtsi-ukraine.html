<p>We first visited the town of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Myn'kivtsi,+Khmel'nyts'ka+oblast,+Ukraine,+32463/@48.8540176,27.0877618,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4732519a04093d49:0x45ed4f04a1db4ec">Myn’kivtsi, Khmel’nyts’ka oblast, Ukraine, 32463</a> where Samuel (Smiel) Tillman, Iris’ paternal grandfather, was born on Nov 20, 1876. He died in New York City on Jan 19, 1940.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/minkovtsy/">Jewish Geneology page devoted to this town</a> calls it <em>Minkovt’sy</em> although I don’t know why.  The town’s Yiddish name is <em>Minkovitz</em> (<em>מינקאוויץ</em>); its Polish name is <em>Minkowce</em>; its Ukranian name is <em>Myn’kivtsi</em>; etc.</p>

<p>As you can see, the name on the sign is <em>Myn’kivtsi</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04608.jpg" alt="DSC04608" /></p>

<p>What does she see?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04461.jpg" alt="DSC04461" /></p>

<p>Near the center of town we found a sort of park, which seemed to be the result of building a new road a bit away from an old one.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04472.jpg" alt="DSC04472" /></p>

<p>The park had monuments to the dead of many wars, but none that we remember to the people, Jews and non-Jews, murdered by the Nazis. (But their museum remembered them.)</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04466.jpg" alt="DSC04466" /></p>

<p>There were houses on the old road on the other side of the park.  We saw a woman there working in her garden and went over to see her.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04478.jpg" alt="DSC04478" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04502.jpg" alt="DSC04502" /></p>

<p>She was very open and welcoming.  When Alex asked her if there were houses that had belonged to Jews to be seen, she replied “My house belonged to Jews”.  She was so straightforward and acted so naturally about this, that it was oddly comforting to me.  When asked if she remembered any Jews surnamed <em>Tillman</em>, she said she didn’t but immediately called her mother (everyone seemed to have cellphone what worked everywhere).  Her mother remembered people named <em>Stillman</em>.</p>

<p>If you look on <a href="http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/minkovtsy/landsmanshaften.html">this web page</a> you will see a link to a PDF of a journal about Minkowitz written by the <em>United Minkovits Relief Committee</em>, an organization that I can’t find with searches. This journal mentions several people named <em>Stillman</em> but no one named <em>Tillman</em> or an variants.</p>

<p><img src="http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/minkovtsy/United_Minkowitz_relief.jpg" alt="Minkowitz Journal" /></p>

<p>We continued down the old road to an area where a number of Jews had lived.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04499.jpg" alt="DSC04499" /></p>

<p>Did Iris have ancestors here?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04537.jpg" alt="DSC04537" /></p>

<p>Here?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04560.jpg" alt="DSC04560" /></p>

<p>Maybe here?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04581.jpg" alt="DSC04581" /></p>

<p>Alex decided to find the Jewish cemetery, so we drove across the Ushitsa River and up the hill on the other side, on the road to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nova+Ushytsya,+Khmel'nyts'ka+oblast,+Ukraine/@48.8350198,27.2627472,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47325635c58123a1:0x264a6e8c60605f45">Nova Ushytsya, Khmel’nyts’ka oblast, Ukraine</a>.  We kept looking down the hill for the cemetery but couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>Soon we came to the city limits, with Soviet-era monuments.  The mosaic contained a spring that dripped water very slowly.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04587.jpg" alt="DSC04587" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04593.jpg" alt="DSC04593" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04595.jpg" alt="DSC04595" /></p>

<p>We turned back towards Minkovitz and went back past this heroic welder.  Alex, who lived under the Soviets, observed, <em>“Glory to labor, shit to laborers.”</em></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04605.jpg" alt="DSC04605" /></p>

<p>We crossed back over the river into town again, drove up and stopped near a blue car, one of the only cars - maybe the only one? - that we saw in Minkovitz.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04619.jpg" alt="DSC04619" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04635.jpg" alt="DSC04635" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04647.jpg" alt="DSC04647" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04652.jpg" alt="DSC04652" /></p>

<p>While I investigated this beautiful, abandoned Jewish house, Alex and Iris talked with some young men next door.  The young man in the black t-shirt said that he had an elderly uncle who knew town history and was, in fact, the caretaker of a house owned by an Israeli who lived there at certain times of the year!  He got on his cellphone and arranged for a rendezvous on the town square in a few minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04655.jpg" alt="DSC04655" /></p>

<p>The man strode up right on time.  He had been born in 1943. He led us to the Israeli’s house.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04664.jpg" alt="DSC04664" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04667.jpg" alt="DSC04667" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04690.jpg" alt="DSC04690" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04708.jpg" alt="DSC04708" /></p>

<p>We saw a room with posters about the town’s past.  It was probably used 5 years ago on the 70th anniversary of the 1941 Nazi invasion.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04709.jpg" alt="DSC04709" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04710.jpg" alt="DSC04710" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04711.jpg" alt="DSC04711" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04712.jpg" alt="DSC04712" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04717.jpg" alt="DSC04717" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the caretaker’s house was on Chekov’s street, #16.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04727.jpg" alt="DSC04727" /></p>

<p>We then walked back to the square to the fascinating local museum.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04661.jpg" alt="DSC04661" /></p>

<p>After visiting the museum, Alex had enough information to find back roads and managed by asking a couple of people to find the Jewish cemetery.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill were only scattered gravestones in thick bushes.  But up the hill was a newer section with graves in good shape.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04784.jpg" alt="DSC04784" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04745.jpg" alt="DSC04745" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04775.jpg" alt="DSC04775" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04779.jpg" alt="DSC04779" /></p>

<p>We walked back down and closed the old gate.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04786.jpg" alt="DSC04786" /></p>

<p>Outside the wall along the path to the cemetery was the old building where bodies were prepared for burial.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04797.jpg" alt="DSC04797" /></p>

<p>This is the farm on the other side of the other wall and the farmer.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04792.jpg" alt="DSC04792" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti-east-000/server/2016-04-Ukraine/JPGs/2016-04-18-2-mynkivtsi-ukraine/DSC04800.jpg" alt="DSC04800" /></p>

<p>Good-bye, Minkovitz:</p>

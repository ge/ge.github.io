    <p>Our good friend, Alexa Dilworth, created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alexa.dilworth/posts/10153421479756804">Facebook post</a> linking to an <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2015/06/04/a_look_at_eli_reed_s_career_in_the_book_a_long_walk_home_photos.html">article in Slate Magazine</a> about Ei Reed, Magnum’s first African-American photographer.</p>

<p>As I try to become a “better” photographer, I go to workshops, camera clubs, classes, galleries and other places where I hear critical talk about photographs.  I hear about <em>rules</em> for making good photographs, about how people’s eyes move across images, about something called <em>negative space</em> (presumably bad) and about something called <em>composition</em>.  I see technically perfect photographs as well as photos made with toy cameras and cellphones. It’s easy to find HDR color, black &amp; white as well as more natural colors.  Worst of all, I see lots of photos that I don’t like or that leave me indifferent: <strong>This is not a good thing.</strong></p>

<p>For my own enjoyment of photography and other arts, I need to <em>enjoy</em> it more, learn to understand it.  I feel anxious when I look at the work of other photographers: will I like it?  Will I feel competitive and poo-poo what I see?</p>

<p>Thus it was with pleasure and relief that I looked at the photos of Eli Reed: I really liked the photos that I saw at the website.</p>

<p>How about this photo?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/behold/2015/05/Eli%20Reed/217.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg" alt="Photo" /></p>

<p>Surely this photo violates a bunch of <em>rules</em>.  It does have some slanted lines and I guess that it follows the <em>rule of thirds</em> well enough.  But the face of the girl on the right is half-hidden!  That can’t be right!  But my eyes go immediately to her eyes.  Perhaps this is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/13/health/psychology/13face.html">because I’m male</a>; perhaps not.</p>

<p>More importantly, if the girl on the left were not looking so fixedly at the girl <em>whom we cannot see</em>, this photo would not be nearly as good as it is.</p>

<p>I still feel a bit anxious that I’m paying attention to how this photograph <em>feels</em> and to <em>what I see</em> and not enough to its formal properties, its <em>composition</em> and so forth.  So I appreciate and need the validation of seeing this photograph praised by important people.</p>

<p>Check-in begins at 1pm at the Sagebrush Inn in Taos (<a href="http://www.unm.edu/~taosconf/Workshops/schedule.htm">schedule</a>) on Saturday, July 12th, but conference registration doesn't begin until 3pm, Sunday, July 13th.  So why get there before the 13th?</p>

      <li>Celisa says: Are y’all thinking of stopping at all or just looking for a nice route to drive through? If you're thinking of stopping, then the route that takes you on 412 through Springdale and Tulsa could be nice. Once you're in Springdale, you're really close to Fayetteville, so you could drive through the university and get a bit to eat there. In Tulsa, the Philbrook Muesum has wonderful gardens if you wanted to stretch your legs.</li>

Iris and I plan to be at the Sagebrush Inn in Taos from July 13 through July 20th.  Iris will be very busy in poetry workshops while I will be exploring Taos and surroundings and seeing old friends like you, I hope.

Grace gave us two possible addresses for you but didn\'t remember which is current, so I\'m sending two letters in hopes of contacting you.

My mobile phone number is 919-636-5496.  My email is: ge@entenman.net.  Iris\' etc: 919-414-8819 and iris@entenman.net.  We will be at the Sagebrush Inn, which you are surely familiar with.

I hope we can meet and catch up while we\'re there.

<p>Janice Booth said we should go to the area where people wait for tourists and talk to different people.  But I forget exactly what her advice was about places to see.</p>

<p>Frommer's guide (917.9043 Kin 2008) is a lot easier to read than Fodor's.  It recommends the 17-mile <strong>Valley Drive</strong> and make it sound as if we should get someone to drive us.  Tours get to visit places off the Drive.  Make sure a tour sees arches and petroglyphs.  They like Goulding's tours.</p>

<p><a href="http://monumentvalley.net">Sacred Monument Tours</a> has all kinds of tours, vehicle, horse, walking.</p>

  <p>Grace,</p>

  <p>Iris and I have just spent an hour trying to figure out our schedule this summer after Iris' workshop in Taos.</p>

  <p>So far we are sure of our schedule as far as Yakima (we have stops in Monument Valley and Provo UT).  We know we will leave Yakima on July 26th and we know we have to leave Victoria, BC on August 6th.</p>

  <p>So….  Between those two dates we hope that we can visit you on Whidbey Island.  Our schedule currently has us getting there on July 28th, staying one day, and leaving on July 30th.</p>

  <p>Would this be possible and agreeable to you?  If so, could you let us know ASAP?  The hurry is that I need to make ferry reservations to get to Victoria, BC.  Speaking of which, do you know if we could get from your place to Victoria in one day?  It looks as if it requires two ferry rides.</p>

  <p>We are really looking forward to seeing you and hoping that these plans work out.  If the dates we need are simply wrong, but there are other dates after that, let us know: perhaps we could change our route and get there a few days later.</p>

  <p>My best friend Mark from high school always used to talk about Whidbey Island.  I don't remember if he lived there, but he sure spent time there as a boy.  Iris and I will spend several days with Mark in Cloverdale, CA, on our way down the coast, and it would be fun to tell him what the place is like now.</p>

  <p>Iris also tells me that Amber is in Taos, where I will have a lot of time on my hands!  So I hope we get to see her.  Do send us her contact info.</p>

  <p>I have no idea where you are.  That's the wonder of email, I guess: I don't have to know.  Kind of amazing still.</p>

  <p>All my best,

<pre><code>As I mentioned, I'd be happy to cook for you all and your Portland hosts. I've got some lemons in for preserving, and can do a Moroccan meal. But whatever ... I'm pretty handy with handmade pastas,  Moqueca from Bahia, etc.  Let me know your prefs. Happy to do it, it is one thing I can do well!  And I've got a few LPs and CDs we could rummage through. And a kick ass tube powered audio system! 

Let  me know your thoughts. Otherwise, happy to meet anywhere.  There are some great beer places. One of my faves is the Horsebrass Pub which has at least 50-60 beers on tap, and decent pub grub. Comfy British pub ambiance.  But there are a million brew pubs that serve their own brews. I like HB because they have such a great variety, and the turnover is constant, so it's very fresh stuff.  To me, lots of the local beers are mostly flash, and not very appealing. Oh, one other IPA I like is Breakside…their pub (north) has decent food also. Outdoor seating.  Deschutes has a lot of local beers only available at the pub downtown…food is ok, not terrible at all. Again, a lot of the beers are sort of silly to me. But I'm very conservative. !!!!

One walk we really enjoyed was in Wasington park.  You take the tram (only $1 for seniors) to the zoo.  Fro there you walk to the Japanese gardens as well as the rose garden.  It's about a 2 hour round trip.  The Japanese garden is first rate.  Don't know about the rose garden.  The zoo is over rated.

<h4 id="directions-to-mark--xandras">Directions to Mark &amp; Xandra’s</h4>

<pre><code>Howdy. George &amp; Iris!

I'm assuming you will stay in Trinidad on Sunday (8/17), and arrive in Cloverdale sometime Monday (8/18) afternoon.  ??

Oliver starts school on Monday (Geyserville), and has soccer practice that evening at 6 PM, in Cloverdale. Perhaps we can all stop by the soccer practice so you can see Rebecca, Oliver &amp; Randy.

Xandra has a meeting Tuesday morning, so we won't be able to leave for Gualala until about 1:30 PM.

See you soon!


Directions to Mark &amp; Xandra's house:

From the North, via US 101

We are about 26 miles South of Ukiah, CA.  Hopland will be the last town before Cloverdale, about 11 miles from Cloverdale.

Our house is about 2 miles from the North Cloverdale city limit.

Our house is at the South end of Cloverdale, but if you want to drive through central Cloverdale (to check it out), take the (first) Cloverdale exit. The sign will say something like “Cloverdale, CA 128, Mendocino”. Turn left (heading South) onto CA 128 — N. Redwood Highway. Continue straight on N. Redwood Highway (DON’T turn right towards Booneville), which becomes N. Cloverdale Blvd.

Drive through “downtown” Cloverdale on Cloverdale Blvd. You will pass through two stoplights; at First Street, and at Citrus Fair Drive. Continue South on “The Boulevard”, which will curve to the left a bit, just past the Owl Cafe. There will be a stoplight at Brookside Drive. There is an Ace Hardware store in a very small business center on the left. Turn right onto Brookside, drive one block and turn left onto Foothill Blvd. Drive several blocks on Foothill to Elbridge Avenue. There is a park (Furber Park) on the left, just before Elbridge. Turn right onto Elbridge.

Drive one block on Elbridge to Ranch House Drive; turn left on Ranch House, drive a short block to Cottage Court (our street) turn left (the only choice) onto Cottage Court. Our house is the third on the left from the corner, #304. You may park in our driveway.

If you wish to avoid the drive through Cloverdale, take the third (last) Cloverdale exit, #519, bypassing the Highway 128 and Citrus Fair exits. Turn right at the bottom of the off-ramp, and right again onto S Cloverdale Blvd.
Turn left at the next street, just past the Chevron station, on the left (Shell station is on the right), onto Treadway Drive. Drive a short distance; Treadway ends at Foothill Blvd. Turn right onto Foothill, and then turn left at the next street, which is Ranch House Drive.

Ranch House will curve to the right (at the base of an undeveloped hillside). Drive past Homewood Court. The next street is Cottage Court; turn right (the only option). Our house is the first 2-story on the left, #304.

 Welcome!        It will be so nice to see you, again.

~~  Mark

Just in case:  Our house phone is 707-894-9618;        Mark's cell is 707-480-4858;          Xandra's cell is 707-480-4879

<h4 id="august-12">August 12</h4>

<pre><code>Howdy, again, George &amp; Iris.

Great news about the room! In the nick of time.

You probably have it nailed, with your laptop (iPad?), GPS in the car (?), etc., but ...

From 101, take exit 731; turn right at the stop sign (Seawood Drive?), drive a short distance, and then turn left onto Patricks point Drive. Trinidad Inn is a bit more than a mile South, on the right.

From The Inn, it's about a mile or a bit more to Main Street, Trinidad. There is a food market near the intersection, in case you need stuff to make dinner at The Inn.

If you cross Main Street, Patrick's Point Drive becomes Scenic Drive, which is where the casino restaurant is located.

If you turn right onto Main Street (from Patrick's Point) you will likely end up at the harbor. Main runs into Trinity Street, which ends at Edwards Street. You will see Trinidad Bay and Head. There is a lighthouse memorial mini-park there; a memorial to those "lost at sea". Following Edwards Street will take you past the marine lab and down to the harbor. Be sure to check out the great open-ocean beach (on the right) before the drive to the harbor parking lot.

Trinidad Head and the nearby ocean beach are great places to catch the sunset (fog permitting). As are the several lookout points at or near Patrick's Point State Park, which will be 3 — 4 miles North of The Inn.

Whenever you have a good view of the ocean, look for whales. It is not "official" whale season (March - June, heading North), but we've seen more whales in August than we have "in season". We've usually seen solitary cow/calf pairs, with no sign of other whales. Often, they just chug along near the surface, barely submerged. They hug the coastline to avoid their chief predator, the Great Whites.


Today is our 43rd wedding anniversary (August 12, 1971, in Seattle). And they said it couldn't last. We're going out to dinner tonight, to burn up a gift certificate to a restaurant we rarely visit.

I'm so lucky to have met Xandra; best friends and partners-for-life, much more to come, I hope.

You've found yours, too, it seems. A hug to Iris from us. Iris, a big hug to George.

Please remember me to Mary. I'm sorry we haven't kept in touch. I have fond memories.

See you soon!

<h4 id="aug-12-notes-on-trinidad">Aug 12 notes on Trinidad</h4>

<pre><code>Howdy, George &amp; Iris!

George, regarding our phone conversation last night, I, too, was/am confused. I had forgotten how far South Medford is from Portland. I guess I was thinking of Corvallis or Eugene. So going to Florence isn't going to be practical.

It looks like the best way to Highway 101 from Medford would be to take Highway US 199 from Grants Pass, OR to Crescent City, CA. According to Google, that route is 111 miles (2 hours, 9 minutes) from Medford. Mary likely knows a lot about that drive.

From Crescent City to Trinidad (US 101), CA is 62 miles (1 hour, 9 minutes), per Google.

So... the total drive from Medford to Trinidad should be about 173 miles and 3 hours, 18 minutes. You should have enough time to check-in to your lodging and enjoy a leisurely romp around Trinidad Harbor. Reserve your lodging ASAP; this is the height of tourist season, and there are not that many "good" places to stay in the area.

The drive from Trinidad to Cloverdale is 208 miles (3 hours, 34 minutes). This drive-time may not be realistic; I recall needing about 4 to 5 hours for this drive, but we enjoy frequent photo-opportunity stops.

Anyway, it looks like about a total of 381 miles from Medford to Cloverdale (Which you've noted in your schedule.), probably about a 7 hour drive, not counting stops. So... Trinidad is nearly the half-way point between Medford and Cloverdale. I recommend a layover in Trinidad. IMHO, there is no place even remotely as nice for a layover as Trinidad, between there and Cloverdale.

Trinidad's signature feature is a beautiful small, sheltered harbor and wharf, with a nice beach on the ocean side. Humboldt State University has a marine lab there and maintains a research vessel in the harbor. Many decades ago, I lived in a small house next to the marine lab for a few months, while house and job sitting for a friend who was a sort-of manager/caretaker of the lab.

The place we usually stay in the Trinidad area is the Trinidad Inn; 1170 Patricks Point Drive, Trinidad, CA 95570; 707-677-3349     www.trinidadinn.com/
Take Patrick’s Point exit, North of Trinidad. The motel is on the West side (right) of Patrick's Point Drive, heading South.

This place is nothing fancy, but kinda cute, clean, with pleasant grounds and surroundings. Last time here (2007), we stayed in room 4, which had a bedroom (queen bed) and a full kitchen, for about $90/night. I'm sure it's more, now. The pictures on the Web site are accurate.

The last time we stayed in Trinidad (2008), the entire Trinidad Inn was booked up for large wedding party, so we ended up staying at View Crest Lodge; 3415 Patrick’s Point Drive; Trinidad, CA. This place is on the East side of Patrick's Point Drive, and has a series of individual cabins along a winding hillside driveway. They only had one cabin left, which was very small, but cute and comfortable, and with a partial ocean view (And we could hear the sea lions barking.). It had a queen bed, and a small refrigerator and a microwave oven, which are both a near-necessity for Xandra. We paid $95/night; room 1A.

We haven't been to Trinidad since 2008, but the good dining choices have always been very limited. When we've experimented, we've been disappointed. Our usuals have been the Trinidad Bay Eatery &amp; Gallery, 607 Parker St, Trinidad, CA 95570 (for breakfast and/or lunch), and the Sunset Restaurant at the "Cher-Ae-Heights" Casino; 27 Scenic Drive, Trinidad (dinner).

Things change, so no guarantees, but we've had good breakfasts at the Trinidad Bay Eatery. Another good breakfast/lunch place is Beachcomber Cafe; 363 Trinity Street. For some reason it was closed the last few times we were in Trinidad. Both of these places can get very busy.

There is an old restaurant right down in the harbor, the Seascape, which was a great, if funky, "locals" spot for breakfast, and for clam chowder &amp; fish 'n' chips. The casino tribe has taken it over and it looked very busy at lunchtime, the last time we were down at the harbor. I haven't eaten there for a very long time, so I don't know how it is.

We've eaten dinner at the Sunset Restaurant (at casino) about six times. Each time we've been very pleased. Usually we get a window view table; there is a beautiful view of Trinidad Head and Harbor and of the open ocean.
The food has always been very good, but not inexpensive. Xandra usually orders a steak, which (with salad, potato, etc.) is about $35. I usually order several appetizers (clam chowder, crab cakes, salad) instead of an entrée.
The clam chowder, and the crab cakes, were among the best I've ever eaten. If I remember correctly, you can walk in the casino front entrance and (to the right) almost directly into the restaurant area, without having to walk past all of the "gaming" devices and the pathetic losers who haven't learned that casinos aren't built to give money away.

I hope this helps!     You could say goodbye to Mary late Saturday (8/16) morning and still make it to our house by early Sunday (8/17) afternoon, as we've planned. By Friday evening, Mary would have had her fill of you, anyway.  : &gt; )   Monday could be a day of resting up a bit before heading for Gualala on Tuesday (8/19). Let us know your plans!

By-the-way, there are at least three driving routes to Gualala from Cloverdale, all very scenic, but there is no easy, quick way. I prefer Highway CA 128, through the Anderson Valley to Booneville and then Mountain View Road from Booneville to Point Arena, then Highway 1 to Gualala. That route is about 80 miles, 2 hours. A beautiful drive.

Also by-the-way, are you folks still interested in visiting Jill Hannum (friend of Susan Simone?) who apparently has a place near Yorkville ("the wilds"). Yorkville is several wide spots along the road, including a post office and fire station, on Highway 128, on the way to The Ocean from Cloverdale. I asked my barber who lives in Yorkville , Sandy Hammond, but she's never heard of Jill Hannum. She thinks that Jill may live on Yorkville Ranch Road (unpaved, I think), which is a bit West of Yorkville. Probably about 20 miles from our house.

You are almost here! After many miles and a lot of driving. We're anxious to see you both again, and to hear your tales of travel and adventure! See you soon!

<p>Cloverdale has two brewpubs: A local brewpub (Ruth McGowans), which is also a live music venue, and The Bear Republic, whose brewery is in Cloverdale, but has a restaurant/pub in Healdsburg. Bear Republic beers are sold nationally, I believe.</p>

<p>Ruth McGowans is owned by Mary Ann Brigham, who is a Cloverdale City Councilwoman, and was almost single-handedly responsible for the creation of our Performing Arts Center.</p>

</ul>

<p>2) Also last year, "The Clover Theater rose from the ashes in June 2013 when husband and wife team Ryan and Kathryn Hecht moved from New York City to bring the theater back to life." These folks used a "Kickstarter" campaign to raise the funds necessary to upgrade the theater, raising $60K in 3 or 4 days! Apparently, they were unable to get enough conventional financing to complete the whole deal. We were "Kickstarters", and our investment has been returned in movie tickets, popcorn, and a tee-shirt. I think that a lot of these funds were raised from family, friends, and associates of the entrepreneurial couple, but a fair amount had to have come from Cloverdale citizens, too. Amazing!</p>

<h3 id="gualala">Gualala</h3>

<p>Gualala!  We're hoping we four can spend a few days together at our old coastal getaway lodging, "Breakers Inn". We stayed there for two nights, several weeks ago (May 16 &amp; 17). We hadn't been there for several years, but have been visiting for about 12 years, usually twice a year. Now that we don't have Rebecca's family living with us, the "need to flee" is not imperative.</p>

<p>You may recall, California has severely restricted coastal development (thankfully!). This is one of the very few coastal lodgings in NorCal that is right on the water, at the mouth of the Gualala River. The rooms face the ocean and most have outdoor balconies. The Gualala river is about 60 feet from the balconies, and the ocean is about 150 yards away. The two bodies of water are separated by a sandbar. The sandbar is part of the Gualala Point Regional Park (Sonoma County). The park and long sandbar beach would be great for hiking (We've not tried that, yet.).</p>

<p>If you didn't know, the Gualala River forms the coastal boundary between Sonoma and Mendocino Counties. The rooms at Breakers Inn are named after U.S. states, or other countries. Our favorite has always been "Pennsylvania", where we stayed once again. Gualala is in a coastal "banana belt" and has weather that is usually much more pleasant than, say, Bodega Bay.</p>

<p>Here are a few links, so that you'll have an idea of what I'm enthused about. In the link below, you can get a glimpse of our view in the photo (s) of our favorite room.</p>

<p>Our recent visit here was to visit a friend, Nancy, who lives about 6 miles North of Gualala. Unfortunately, our friend has end-stage cancer and, while still active, she is beginning to show external signs of debility. We were able to visit while she is still ambulatory and capable.</p>

  <p>To the best of my knowledge at this point, August 21 is just fine. Plans can be fine-tuned later depending on weather, etc. The four of you will be traveling together? Sounds like grand fun and I'd enjoy meeting folks from Cdale, where I've only one acquaintance. It is really lovely here, see attached photo from my deck looking NE, but late August can be brutally hot and dry. Or not. I have room to house you all for overnight or longer, but bear in mind that it's a 35 minute drive from Hwy 128 on a 9 mile dirt road that's very well maintained but is happiest with a 4WD or AWD car on its surface. Driver is happier, too. Again, it can be played by ear. An alternative to R and R in the wild would be to spend a day together in Anderson Valley, check out Hendy Woods State Park (one of the last patches of virgin redwood forest in the area), a couple of wineries, a good lunch or dinner…..Your choice….</p>

  <p>Dear Jill,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have room to house you all for overnight or longer, but bear in mind that it's a 35 minute drive from Hwy 128 on a 9 mile dirt road that's very well maintained but is happiest with a 4WD or AWD car on its surface.  Driver is happier, too.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Iris signed up to go to Taos in July to study poetry, she said she would have to buy a new car, and she did: a Passat TDI, a fabulous road car.  By the time we get out of Monument Valley after leaving Taos, we should have an idea of how the car will perform on your dirt road.  If we're unsure, I'm pretty sure that Mark has some kind of pickup that might carry us all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>An alternative to R and R in the wild would be to spend a day together in Anderson Valley, check out Hendy Woods State Park (one of the last patches of virgin redwood forest in the area), a couple of wineries, a good lunch or dinner.  Your choice.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such a tempting alternative!  I'm sure we will discuss this a lot before the big day arrives!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for telling me how to pronounce "Gualala".  I might have made a terrible gaff!  I guess I'll hope that it's hot in Gualala.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Simone filled me in on Iris's bio and my guess is that given her documentary film interest we'll know or know of folks in common.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Simone was mum about you, so I duckduckgoed (I boycott google) you but without joining linked in found little in a minisearch.  What's an Education coordinator?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm a lot less interesting than Iris, as explained by my ID-badge:</p>

<p><img src="GeorgeEntenman-iris-husband.png" alt="Iris\' husband" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of my life's highlights: growing up in Berkeley, Peace Corps volunteer in Gafsa, Tunisia, lots of grad school, PhD in linguistica, publisher’s rep for 3 years, recycling into computers, developed software to design VLSI chips, ecommerce, database work for a good non-profit.  Currently a guardian-ad-litem (also known as a CASA) in my retirement.  I'm kind of dissappointed in old duckduckgo, which I also use.</p>

  <p>Indeed.  We can't wait to meet you.</p>

# From Chapel Hill to Taos

Google shows [three routes](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/5+Bartram+Dr,+Chapel+Hill,+NC+27517/Taos,+NM/@35.4124293,-91.4510652,6z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acc289807eec11:0x8013b3b969c015e4!2m2!1d-79.036239!2d35.892987!1m5!1m1!1s0x871764da7f11fcb1:0x90ea918361a9b782!2m2!1d-105.5730665!2d36.4072485) from Chapel Hill to Taos that are almost equidistant:

![Three routes](images/3RoutesToTaos.png)

Since Google shows only [two routes from Reno to Chapel Hill](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Reno,+NV/5+Bartram+Dr,+Chapel+Hill,+NC+27517/@37.8061955,-100.8974485,5z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x809940ae9292a09d:0x40c5c5ce7438f787!2m2!1d-119.8138027!2d39.5296329!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acc289807eec11:0x8013b3b969c015e4!2m2!1d-79.036239!2d35.892987!5i2), both of which go very near Kansas City, I think we should avoid that route on the way **to** Taos.

# From Chapel Hill to Nashville, TN

![Chapel Hill to Nashville](images/ChapelHillToNashville.png)

Carlos says to take VA route, not Ashville, Rt. go to Whitheville


# From Nashville, TN to Blytheville, AR

**Don's advice:**

>When you leave Nashville, TN, go to Jackson and then take Hwy 412 to Dyersburg, connect to I155 to Caruthersville, MO, and then to I55.  Go south on I55 to Blytheville.  Much shorter route, save about an hour

![Nashville to Blytheville](images/NashvilleToBlytheville.png)

# Blytheville, AR?

Visit Don and Lori.

Find motel.

Visit [a famous bookstore](http://www.thatbookstoreinblytheville.com/) that David Perry told me about.

# From Blytheville, AR to Taos, NM (overview)

# From Tulsa, OK to Guymon, OK (one day)

It takes [a little over 5 hours](http://ww1.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/AAAOnline.woa/6016?association=aaa&poiKey=0&club=111&version=2013&subCommand=routeLocs&routeLocs=Address%7C+%7CTulsa+%7COK%7C+%7C+%7C+%7CAddress%7C+%7CGuymon+%7COK%7C+%7C+%7C&page=ITTServices&sessionRedirect=1402290728512) to get from Tulsa to Guymon.

# From Guymon, OK, to Taos, NM (one day)

It takes about 5 hours to get [from Guymon OK to Taos NM](http://ww1.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/AAAOnline.woa/6016?association=aaa&poiKey=0&club=111&version=2013&subCommand=routeLocs&routeLocs=Address%7C+%7CGuymon+%7COK%7C+%7C+%7C+%7CAddress%7C+%7CTaos+%7CNM%7C+%7C+%7C&page=ITTServices&sessionRedirect=1402290260074).

Notice that this route (there are two) goes through Raton, NM, which looks to be mountanous and more picturesque.

# From Clayton, NM, to Taos, NM (one day)

It takes about 3 hours [from Clayton NM to Taos NM](http://ww1.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/AAAOnline?association=aaa&club=111&page=ITTServices&subCommand=routeLocs&version=2013&routeLocs=Address|+|Clayton%20|NM|%20|%20|%20|Address|+|Taos%20|NM|%20|%20|&poiKey=0)

We could go through Raton from Clayton.

# Taos

Iris found [this website](http://taos.org/trip-ideas/day-trips) with ideas of things for me to do.

Lynn will be there!

Amber may be there.


# Taos to Monument Valley

# Monument Valley

Monument valley is located on US Highway 163 and is 25 miles from Mexican Hat, UT, 51 miles from Bluff, UT and 77 miles from Blanding, UT. It is also 22 miles from Kayenta, AZ and 121 miles from Page, AZ.

[%MV_] belongs to the [Navaho Nations](http://navajonationparks.org/).  The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, Arizona.

We should stop at the [%MV_] [Visitors Center](https://www.utah.com/nationalparks/monumentvalley/visitor-center.htm).

## We will stay in Goulding's Lodge

Fodor's guide recommends staying at [Goulding's Lodge](http://www.gouldings.com/) which has views of [%MV_]!  Web pages related to them don't seem to work, at least from the CH Public Library.  [Kayak](http://kayak.com) doesn't seem able to get prices. I may need to call.

Our reservation is for an apartment, which has several rooms and is separate from the Lodge.  This is because there is a room with a queen bed on the 21st but not the 22nd.
I need to call now and then to see if someone has cancelled.

Reservation details:

* Confirmation #: 209734
* Date I made reservation: Phone call, Feb 6th, 2014
* Lodge phone #: (435) 727-3231
* Rate: $480.44 with AAA card, so be sure to bring AAA card.  
* Credit card:
	* M/C
	* 5466 2862 3487 0856 
	* 565
	* 02/15
	![credit card for the reservation](images/gouldings_cc.png)

## Other places to stay

The "only hotel actually inside the tribal park" is [The View Hotel](http://monumentvalleyview.com).  The cheapest room now is $517!!

They mention [San Juan Inn & Trading Post](http://sanjuaninn.net) in Mexican Hat.  It's a lot cheaper and on the way!

Frommer's guide (917.9043 Kin 2008) is a lot easier to read than Fodor's.  It recommends the 17-mile **Valley Drive** and make it sound as if we should get someone to drive us.  Tours get to visit places off the Drive.  Make sure a tour sees arches and petroglyphs.
They like Goulding's tours.

[Sacred Monument Tours](http://monumentvalley.net) has all kinds of tours, vehicle, horse, walking.

Bluff, just north of Mexican Hat might be a good place to stay, too.

## Things to do in Monument Valley

Janice Booth said we should go to the area where people wait for tourists and talk to different people.  But I forget exactly what her advice was about places to see.

Maria Martin said to see:

* The Goosenecks
* Dead Horse Point

# Monument Valley to Moab

# Moab to Provo

# Provo (two days)

Note: Day One app developer might be in Salt Lake City [check](https://twitter.com/dayoneapp).

# Note: Email from Harry

Google maps says that it's 999 miles and can be driven in 15 hours.

	Dear Lynn

	Google suggests a driving time from Taos to Port Angeles, Wash. of ~27 hours—say three days of steady driving, four or five with a chance to look at some scenery. From Pt. Angeles a car ferry runs 4 times a day in summer, the MV Coho, taking 90 minutes to cross to Victoria. So this would work! We’d have a week at a minimum, maybe more.

	[map](https://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&gl=ca&daddr=Port+Angeles,+WA,+USA&saddr=Taos,+NM,+USA&panel=1&f=d&fb=1&geocode=KbH8EX_aZBeHMYK3qWGDkeqQ%3BKUfn58AMUo5UMdmlT2OMYbxd&ei=UInmUtOvFMXxoATE44HABg&ved=0CIcBEPgPMAs)

	You’d need a reservation on the Coho, which can be googled (it’s owned by Black Ball Ferries). The customs formalities aren’t too bad leaving the US; as I remember you have to be at the ferry dock an hour or two before sailing.

	Start planning!

# From Provo to Port Angeles



## Provo to Boise

[Triptik](http://ww1.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/AAAOnline.woa/5009?association=aaa&poiKey=1&club=111&version=2013&subCommand=routeLocs&routeLocs=Address|3257%20N%20Shadowbrook%20Cir%20|Provo%2084604|UT|%20|%20|%20|Address|%20|Boise%20|ID|%20|%20|&page=ITTServices&sessionRedirect=1400009271517&zip=27514&stateprov=nc&city=chapel+hill&devicecd=PC)

Barry Eschen lives in Boise.

## Provo, UT, to Yakima, WA (two long days)

It takes [11h to get to Yakima](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Provo,+UT/Yakima,+WA/@43.8881806,-120.4995412,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x874d9271930bf1bf:0x1d90f12600b556ef!2m2!1d-111.6585337!2d40.2338438!1m5!1m1!1s0x5497625dd01644ff:0x1a3b860e719e7b4b!2m2!1d-120.5058987!2d46.6020711).

## From Yakima, WA to Port Townsend, WA (one day)

It would take about [4h 26m](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Yakima,+WA/Chimacum,+WA+98339/@47.2546466,-122.6624631,8z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x5497625dd01644ff:0x1a3b860e719e7b4b!2m2!1d-120.5058987!2d46.6020711!3m4!1m2!1d-121.1488636!2d46.9800358!3s0x5490ac80fa1c50df:0xc7aff8f7412f47d3!1m5!1m1!1s0x548fe89be3d8a677:0x155a59d2deb88b64!2m2!1d-122.7694444!2d48.0116667!3e0) to take the 206 mile route by Mt Rainer.

## Port Townsend, WA, to Victoria (if Tom Foley is there)

Tom Foley lives 3 miles from Port Townsend, WA

It's only about an hour [from Chimacum, WA to Port Angeles, WA](http://ww1.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/AAAOnline?association=aaa&club=111&page=ITTServices&subCommand=routeLocs&version=2013&routeLocs=Address|+|chimacum%20|wa|%20|%20|%20|Address|+|port+angeles%20|wa|%20|%20|&poiKey=0).  So we could get to Victoria in one day very easily, provided we get up early!

### Ferry boat

Trip confirmation: #592961FB

# Victoria, BC

# Vancouver, BC

We hope to take the boat to Vancouver, where we may stay for one night before returning.

One thing that we should do there is to visit [Stanley Park](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154943-d155652-Reviews-Stanley_Park-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html).

# Washington

## From Victoria to Portland (four days)

### From Victoria to Widbey Island (one day)

Harry says that if we go via ferry from Anacordes, we have to get there by about 7:30 for customs.


### Stay two nights on Widbey Island (one day)

Don stationed on Widbey Island.

#### Email to Grace

>Grace,
>
>Iris and I have just spent an hour trying to figure out our schedule this summer after Iris' workshop in Taos.
>
>So far we are sure of our schedule as far as Yakima (we have stops in Monument Valley and Provo UT).  We know we will leave Yakima on July 26th and we know we have to leave Victoria, BC on August 6th.
>
>So....  Between those two dates we hope that we can visit you on Whidbey Island.  Our schedule currently has us getting there on July 28th, staying one day, and leaving on July 30th.
>
>Would this be possible and agreeable to you?  If so, could you let us know ASAP?  The hurry is that I need to make ferry reservations to get to Victoria, BC.  Speaking of which, do you know if we could get from your place to Victoria in one day?  It looks as if it requires two ferry rides.
>
>We are really looking forward to seeing you and hoping that these plans work out.  If the dates we need are simply wrong, but there are other dates after that, let us know: perhaps we could change our route and get there a few days later.
>
>My best friend Mark from high school always used to talk about Whidbey Island.  I don't remember if he lived there, but he sure spent time there as a boy.  Iris and I will spend several days with Mark in Cloverdale, CA, on our way down the coast, and it would be fun to tell him what the place is like now.
>
>Iris also tells me that Amber is in Taos, where I will have a lot of time on my hands!  So I hope we get to see her.  Do send us her contact info.
>
>I have no idea where you are.  That's the wonder of email, I guess: I don't have to know.  Kind of amazing still.
>
>All my best,
>ge

## From Widbey Island to Seattle (one day)

Where shall we stay?  I'm going to plan to find a place to stay for the night and leave the next day.

## From Seattle, WA, to Portland, OR (one day)

I don't know why AAA shows [two possible, parallel routes](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Seattle,+WA/Portland,+OR/@46.5597827,-123.7206855,8z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x5490102c93e83355:0x102565466944d59a!2m2!1d-122.3320708!2d47.6062095!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6762071!2d45.5234515!5i1), but it should be easy to switch between the two, as needed.

### Two ways to Mnt Valley

*Taos - 64- farmington to four corners
*41 - 62


### Monument Valley to Moab via Arches

* On Navaho land
* Mexican hat
* Go slightly nw
* Bumpy road
* Go by Goose neck St Park and follow signs to Natural Bridges on 261 then shoot for Moki Dugway, switchbacks uphill. Dirt road. good dirt.
* 261 runs into 163/95.  Turn right if we want to see Moab (recommended). In Moab can decide if we want to see Arches.
* Then hit I-70

So 3 days if we go to Monument Valley.  Drive in and drive out. (?)

* Moab is a good place to stay.  It's about 2 hours to Monument Valley.
* Farmington has good places, too.
* Moab to Provo is 3 hrs.
* Should see Yellowstone.
* Probably two days from Provo to Seattle.
* Family reunion from July 27th.  In Tahoe.

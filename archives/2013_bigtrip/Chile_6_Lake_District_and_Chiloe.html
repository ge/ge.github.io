<h1 id="lake">Chile - Lake District and Chiloe</h1>

<h1 id="trip">Sat, Oct 26 - Bariloche to Osorno</h1>

<p>We got up early and took a taxi to the station in Bariloche, where we caught the bus for the long trip to Osorno, Chile. We had a long wait at the Chilean border where a dog sniffed everyone's bags.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/3_argentina/2_bariloche/2013_10_25_0829lo-res.jpg" alt="Bariloche, Argentina" /> </p>

<h2 id="osorno">Staying in Osorno</h2>

<p>We stayed overnight in Osorno in order to rent a car the next day. </p>

<p>When we got to the bus station in Osorno, George actually succeeded in withdrawing money from SECU! This was the last time this happened - the card was taken by a machine in Fructillar (see below). </p>

<p>We started walking into town with our luggage on our back. We were looking for a place to stay overnight since we planned to rent a car the next day. The tourist agency in the <em>Plaza de Armas</em> was closed for lunch, so we found a nice restaurant for a big lunch. </p>

<p>After lunch, we wandered back to the tourist agency where we found Mauro, who got us a so-so hotel. </p>

<p>We took naps and then walked around Osorno, which reminded George of Mexico (in fact, much of Chile reminded him of Mexico).</p>

<h2 id="beer">Good Beer! So-so bar owner</h2>

<p>Finally we found a bar selling M&auml;rzen beer on tap: it was very good! We ate empa&ntilde;adas, and we were not happy when the owner started telling us how much better life had been under Pinochet, when people showed &quot;respect&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="dessert">Coffee and Dessert</h2>

<p>We found coffee and dessert elsewhere and then went to the city square to sit and take photos before walking back to the <em>Hostel Argentino</em>, Casanova No 985, Osorno</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1_osorno/2013_10_26_0871lo-res.jpg" alt="Osorno, Chile" />

<h2 id="hotel">Hostel Argentino</h2>

<p>George went downstairs in the hosteleria looking for Wi-fi and had a long, friendly talk with Veronica, who suggested that we go to Frutillar, a suggestion that we later followed, to our great pleasure.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1_osorno/2013_10_26_0878lo-res.jpg" alt="Osorno, Chile" />

<h1 id="huilohuilo">Huilo Huilo, Chile</h1>

<h2 id="neltume">Sun, Oct 27 - Osorno to Neltume</h2>

<p>We ate breakfast and talked with Luiz, owner of the hostel in Osorno. </p>

<p>We took a taxi to the Osorno airport, which was deserted except for some janitorial staff. There was no sign of our rental car agent. Of course, we were there about 2 hours before we were supposed to get the car in hopes of leaving a bit earlier.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1_osorno/2013_10_26_0881lo-res.jpg" alt="Osorno, Chile" /> </p>

<p>We waited about an hour and a half. George dragged a chair over to a power plug and enjoyed powered Wi-Fi. </p>

<p>Finally we got a car and drove to Huilo Huilo. It was very dusty there and somewhat unclear where we were supposed to go, but the large, crazy hotel was a good clue!</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1b_huilo_huilo/2013_10_27_0909lo-res.jpg" alt="1b_huilo_huilo, Chile" />

<p>After deciding against the overpriced hotel at Huilo Huilo, we found a great place to stay in Neltume, a poor-looking, unpretentious, dusty town a few miles away. We found a fantastic place to stay for much less than the big hotel. </p>

<p>After settling in, we drove back through the dust to the hotel to reserve a guided walk on the nearby volcano the next morning. </p>

<p>We ate in a poor restaurant with no Wi-Fi. But the sunset was beautiful. </p>

<p>We went back and sat outside our little <em>caba&ntilde;a</em> - wine, river, dogs visiting - it was very peaceful. </p>

<p>This is the <em>caba&ntilde;a</em> where we stayed in Neltume, near Huilo Huilo.</p>

<h2 id="volcano">Mon, Oct 28 - the High Point of the Trip!</h2>

<p>A busy day: </p>

<ul>
<li>David and George hiked up Vulc&aacute;n Mocho-Choswenko.</li>
<li>They hiked to two waterfalls.</li>
<li>David grilled a fabulous dinner for three.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday we went to the desk in the Huilo Huilo Hotel where people arranged for excursions and adventures. We asked about hiking on the volcano Mocho-Choswenko, the beautiful mountain that hovers over the whole area. We wanted to hike to the top. </p>

<p>The kids behind the desk took a short look at us and said that we would be better off taking a shorter hike, promising that it would be beautiful yet possible for us old guys. We agreed and paid for a shorter hike and arranged to come back the next day at 10am. </p>

<p>This map shows the relative sizes and placement of Huilo Huilo, Neltume and the volcano.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1b_huilo_huilo/Huilo_Huilo.png" alt="1b_huilo_huilo, Chile" /> </p>

<p>We woke fairly early in our beautiful <em>caba&ntilde;a</em> and had a meager breakfast (we hadn't done any shopping in Neltume). We drove to the hotel, parked and walked to the Huilo Huilo reservation desk. After waiting a bit, Rogelio, a 27 year old local who had studied tourism, was assigned to be our guide, and we went outside and got into a wonderful 4WD vehicle that felt very &quot;trekky&quot;, mainly because is was noisy and had a radio antenna smack in the middle of the hood. It was fun hearing him use the radio as we took a long road up out of the trees and bushes onto the desolate slopes of the volcano. </p>

<p>Rogelio, our guide, drove us to the snow line.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1b_huilo_huilo/2013_10_27_0987lo-res.jpg" alt="1b_huilo_huilo, Chile" />

<p>We stopped where the snow began and we climbed into a wonderful tracked vehicle driven by a hooded driver with mirror sunglasses. We held on tightly as we rode up the mountain, the vehicle making scary, sliding motions as it turned (tracks feel different from wheels). This was a very thrilling ride up the snowy slopes to a supply hut. David said this ride alone was worth the price of admission!</p>

<p>At the supply hut we were fitted with plastic snowshoes and ski poles and told to start climbing the very steep slope towards one of the volcano's cones.</p>

<p>The hike up was very hard. George pulled ahead of David and Rogelio. This enabled him to keep going, pretending to have no knowledge of where we were supposed to stop (a rock about halfway up the slope). So he probably went farther than we were supposed to before Rogelio shot up the hill and told him to stop. Fortunately he had reached a beautiful spot. It was impossible to tell how close it was to the base of the cone, but it seemed quite close. It was very beautiful there, with a spectacular view. And we were glad to stop - it was a <em>very</em> hard hike. We were happy and tired. </p>

<p>Snowshoeing down was hard and kind of scary.</p>

<h2 id="waterfalls">Waterfalls</h2>

<p>After we got back from the volcano we went shopping at both of Neltume's two <em>supermercados</em> and their <em>panaderia</em>. David was ecstatic when he found frozen <em>picanha</em>, a cut of meat critical to good Brazilian grilling. We put the <em>picanha</em> in water to thaw it, and then drove off to see Huilo Huilo's two waterfalls, Salto Huilo Huilo and Salto Puma. The river feeding them ran in back of our cute little hut in Neltume. </p>

<p>We took short hikes to each waterfall. The rainbow at Salto Huilo Huilo reminded George of his beautiful wife, Iris (think of the word for &quot;rainbow&quot; in Spanish).</p>

<h2 id="dinner">Dinner at Home</h2>

<p>David built a fire in the grill under the shelter near our hut and cooked a fabulous dinner. </p>

<p>Lorena, the woman who managed the <em>caba&ntilde;as</em> where we were staying, accepted David's invitation to join us for a glass of wine. </p>

<p>David's magical way of serving small pieces of meat kept Lorena at the table until long past her usual bedtime. Lorena is 40, with a daughter, Fernanda, 9, and son, 14, and could simply call home to tell them she'd be late. So we talked long into the night. </p>

<p>We learned that Lorena has a brother in Canada who had been tortured by Pinochet because he had been interested in poor people in Neltume. He spent 3 years in jail and left the country shortly after getting out. He has grown very distant from his family, causing great pain to his parents. Lorena was only 3 when her brother left, so they are not like siblings. </p>

<p>Lorena turned out to be Rogelio's aunt! He's the son of her brother Jorge. </p>

<p>This was probably the most wonderful day of many on the whole trip.</p>

<h1 id="baths">Tues, Oct 29 - Termas Geometricas</h1>

<p>We left Neltume and drove to Termas Geometricas, a hot springs that Carola and Mike Hess had recommended to us (they had also recommended that we go to Huilo Huilo). </p>

<p>We had our first flat tire, a slow leak, on the long gravel road there, so we inflated it and kept on driving. </p>

<p>We spend about three hours in the hot springs, moving among pools of different temperatures. </p>

<p>George got to practice his French with a group of bikini-clad wives who had left their engineer husbands in French Guiana, France's space port.</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a> </p>

<h1 id="pucon">Puc&oacute;n, Chile</h1>

<p>After we finished our hot baths, we drove to a nearby town and got our tire repaired.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1d_pucon/2013_10_29_1142lo-res.jpg" alt="1d_pucon, Chile" />

<p>Then we drove to Puc&oacute;n and found a place for the night (a terrible place). </p>

<p>We had a very nice dinner in Puc&oacute;n in a restaurant where we spoke with a nice couple from Australia. He was from England and she was from Uganda, probably of Indian origin. They have traveled the length of Africa! They're riding a rented BMW motorcycle here.</p>

<h1 id="frutillar">Frutillar, Chile</h1>

<h2 id="ftrip">Weds, October 30 - Puc&oacute;n =&gt; Frutillar</h2>

<p>We woke up in our ratty hosteleria in Puc&oacute;n. David went out shopping for food leaving George to post to our blog over yet another tediously slow wi-fi. </p>

<p>David returned with the news that our left rear tire was flat. He asked our landlady, who told us that we could fix it across the street when they opened so we waited and waited for its gate to open. Finally George walked over and found that they were open and did <em>not</em> fix tires. </p>

<p>We put the Emergency spare on and drove to a place that pulled out a nail but found no leak. They resealed the rims and off we went.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/1d_pucon/2013_10_29_1166lo-res.jpg" alt="1d_pucon, Chile" /> </p>

<p>We drove to Frutillar, a tiny town on a huge lake, where we started looking for a place to stay. Fortunately the first three places we tried were either full or failed to answer their doorbells, because that caused us to venture a little further down the road, where we found the fantastic <a href="http://www.xn--cabaaselbosquepatagonico-3kc.cl">Caba&ntilde;as el Bosque</a> slightly up the hill, with a view of the lake and the volcanoes on the other side. </p>

<p>George went out walking. Wanting to get some cash, he went to an ATM at the Bank of Santander, which gave him some money but then took his debit card! No amount of arguing with the bank guard or the officials inside did any good. (He called later and had the card put on hold.) </p>

<p>David and George eventually met and walked around some more. Frutillar is an absolutely lovely town. It doesn't take long to walk from one end to the other, past German restaurants and pastry shops and past a spectacular theater built over the lake. </p>

<p>We had dinner in a nice place with reasonable food and then walked home - we needed our flashlight. </p>

<p>George went up to the house of Luis, who owns the <em>caba&ntilde;as</em>, to use the Wi-Fi. Luis invited him into his place, which was like<br/>
a bachelor pad. George called SECU on Skype. </p>

<h2 id="exploring">Thurs, Oct 31 - Exploring Frutillar</h2>

<h3 id="morning">Morning in Frutillar</h3>

<p>George slept well, enjoying the cool air in Frutillar, but woke up with a cough. </p>

<p>It started raining a little before 9am, making it hard to sit outside Luis's place to get Wi-Fi. Luis's dogs, Wally and Oliver, visit, which is always nice. </p>

<p>We drove to Upper Frutillar and bought food to eat at our caba&ntilde;a. Then we drove back down to Lower Fructillar, along the lake, and went to Cato's Bar where we had okay drinks, lousy pizza and good Wi-Fi. It turned out to be a kid's bar, at least on Halloween. </p>

<p>We couldn't pay for our food with credit cards due to problems with their system. Money was one of the most stressful parts of the trip, especially after George's debit card worked so rarely and was then taken away. </p>

<h3 id="pvaras">Short day trip to Porto Varas</h3>

<p>It was pretty shabby, not shabby for Chile, but shabby for a town which seems to be a trendy spot for international jet-setters. It didn't live up to its reputation, but it did have a nice new market and a beautiful old harbor, a nice place for empa&ntilde;adas and another place with dessert, Wi-Fi and a good view of the rain.</p>

<h2 id="dead">Fri, Nov 1 - Day of the Dead - Day trip to the island of Chilo&eacute;</h2>

<p>We took the tollway straight to Chacao and just drove straight to the ferry boat. </p>

<p>Once on Chilo&eacute;, we drove straight to the town of Ancud, situated on a harbor in the Canal de Chacao.  It was kind of shabby but very lively, with a new market and traffic lights still covered with plastic.</p>

<p>We started driving west towards the Pacific so that George could find his roots. </p>

<p>We were diverted towards Pu&ntilde;ihuil by a man who we gave a ride to. We stopped for a stunning cliff-view of the Pacific and then continued on down to the Pu&ntilde;ihuil beach, where we quickly touched the <em>Mother of all Oceans</em> and left without taking a tourist boat out to see pinguins on the rocks.</p>

<h3 id="castro">Castro, a town on Chilo&eacute;</h3>

<p>We parked on town square where we'd been told we could find the market, but there was no market. We had to ask three people to find a place that was clearly intended for tourists - it had mostly handicrafts and little food, so it wasn't really a market to the locals. </p>

<p>David wanted to try <em>curanto</em>, a local specialty, and we found the <a href="http://dondeeladio.cl/">Donde Eladio Restaurante y Fog&oacute;n</a> across from the tourist market. Our wonderfully crazy waiter asked what language we wanted to speak, and we chose Portuguese, so he spoke Portuguese with us the whole time! The <em>curanto</em> was not very special, but the waiter was! </p>

<p>After lunch we walked up the very steep hill towards our car and had coffee in a nice little caf&eacute;. Two elderly women with stickers looked like Democratic precinct workers &amp; sat behind George.</p>

<h3 id="backtotown">Castro to Frutillar</h3>

<p>We drove back along the interior coast of Chilo&eacute; from Castro to the ferry and from the other side to Frutillar. </p>

<p>We drove through towns with names like <em>Dalcahue</em>. We had to drive around <em>Dalcahue</em> a long time looking for the road to <em>Quemchi</em> before we eventually found it. </p>

<p>On the rode towards <em>Quemchi</em> David scared himself, almost spinning the car to avoid a bozo in the middle of the road; George was calm. </p>

<p>We kept moving past <em>Linao</em> to the ferry boat. </p>

<p>We got back to Frutillar as our gasoline was getting very low and we were getting very worried.</p>

<h2 id="lake">Sat, Nov 2 - Long day trip around Lago Llanquihue</h2>

<p>Driving up to Frutillar Alto, we found a cowboy fair where the cowboys used their horses to chase cows. This colorful event lasted two days.</p>

<p><br /><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/zabouti_000/4_chile/2c_frutillar/2013_11_01_1403lo-res.jpg" alt="Frutillar, Chile" />

<h3 id="petrohue">Petrohu&eacute;</h3>

<p>From Frutillar we drove along the south shore of Lake Llanquihue to Ensenada on the east side of Lake Llanquihue where we picked up two cute hitchhikers, Berni and Cote Lira, sisters from Santiago. </p>

<p>We drove to Salto de Petrohu&eacute;, beautiful waterfalls on the road to Petrohu&eacute;.<br/>
And from there we drove to Petrohu&eacute; and the beautiful Lago Todos los Santos. </p>

<p>We all decided to hike on the <em>Sendero Paso Desolation</em> a trail that went up the back of Vulc&aacute;n Osorno. Since David and George wanted time to drive up onto Osorno, we watched the time and stopped after 50 minutes for a wonderful picnic sitting on volcanic soil looking out towards the lake and mountains. </p>

<p>After lunch, the two young women continued their walk while David and George walked back and drove to the volcano.</p>

<p>The drive up was impressive, seemingly much longer and as steep as Mt Mitchell, only instead of arriving at the top, we arrived at a parking lot and ski lift. We took the lower lift (the upper was closed). </p>

<p>It was beautiful but we were unhappy to learn that we didn't have time to walk to a nearby crater. We rode the lift down and then drove out.</p>

<h3 id="frutillaragain">Return to Frutillar on the north side of the lake</h3>

<p>Unlike the more developed south side of Lake Llanquehue, the north side had far fewer houses and many more large farms with incredible views of volcanoes.</p>

<p>We were driving along peacefully when David slammed on the brakes: he had seen <em>a very important sign</em>. Ole Eagle Eye had just found the best smoked salmon empa&ntilde;adas of the whole trip! Yum!</p>

<p>We had omelettes for dinner and then sat in the hot tub drinking pisco. </p>

<p>The cabin's gas bottle had run out so there was no hot water for a post hot-tub shower. </p>

<p>After we went to bed, we could hear someone playing guitar in the hot-tub. </p>

<h2 id="lazyday">Sun, Nov 3 - lazy day in Frutillar</h2>

<p>This was a lazy, down day. </p>

<p>After breakfast we walked into town and stopped for a sandwich at a caf&eacute; that attracted tourists with wooden gremlins. We ate salmon sandwiches with panini bread. David said that ricotta cheese really made salmon special. </p>

<p>Walked to Frutillar's music hall, where David got a saxophone Xmas ornament. </p>

<p>Then we walked to an amazing, tiny, German pastry place for apple strudel and espresso. </p>

<p>We went grocery shopping in Frutillar Alto. </p>

<p>Luiz came over for dinner. David cooked yet another wonderful churrasco. </p>

<p>We went to bed early.</p>

<h2 id="anotherday">Mon, Nov 4 - stay another day in Frutillar</h2>

<p>George went to the Bank of Santander to try to get his debit card back. The place was packed. When he finally got the attention of bank employees, they told him that his card had been destroyed. At least that's what he thinks they told him. </p>

<p>We walked badk to our caba&ntilde;as where we slept, ate lunch and then talked at length with Luis, who had told us that he could rent us his apartment in Santiago for the same reasonable rate we were paying for the caba&ntilde;a. </p>

<p>We took a beautiful walk in the botanical gardens just up the hill from our caba&ntilde;as. </p>

<p>Then after an afternoon nap, we walked down into town for dinner at the Caf&eacute; Alem&aacute;n, a fairly fancy German restaurant.<br/>
The volcanoes were clear and slightly pink in the evening light. Unfortunately dinner did not live up to expectations, but the beer was good. </p>

<p>We walked home, where George sat outside using Luis' Wi-Fi. When he got back to the caba&ntilde;a, he realized that he had lost his glasses. Not too serious - they were cheap reading glasses. </p>

<p>Both of David's hamstrings were hurting him. </p>

<p>George took more codeine and went to sleep.</p>

<h2 id="triptosantiago">Tues, Nov 5 - Frutillar - Osorno - Santiago</h2>

<p>George woke up around 3am and knew that his body had figured out how to beat his cold! In fact, his cough persisted until well after getting back to the US, but the underlying illness was gone. Thanks to Dr Ricardo Halpern and his prescription for codeïne pills! </p>

<p>Later after breakfast, David did some through searching and found George's glasses. As he suspected, Wally had taken them. He'd taken the strap off, but it want right back on, and the glasses were good to go! </p>

<p>George slept much of the morning. </p>

<p>David drove us to Osorno. We got there a little early and had some very good coffee in a small coffee shop. We waited until it was time to return the rental car. After considerable searching and luck, we finally found the place where we could return the rental car! </p>

<p>The rental car agent was kind enough to drive us to the bus station. We got there about 5 hours before the bus left for Santiago. We checked our bags in the VIP waiting room and walked around Osorno. </p>

<p>We walked around looking at shops and people. David bought a camp toaster, a sewing kit, etc. </p>

<p>Suddenly David got hungry and we found ourselves in a bar drinking Märzen beer and watching futbol. As he ate David made little comments: good crackers, bad olives, great beer, and he was right! </p>

<p>We sat in the public Wi-Fi section of the <em>Plaza de Armas</em>, but the Wi-Fi still didn't work. </p>

<p>We walked around some more, looking in stores and finally went to wait in the Pullman Bus VIP area, where they charged us to watch our bags and tried to send us to the bathrooms in the terminal. </p>

<p>George went to a supermercado organized like a Target, mixing food and merchandise and a terrible checkout line. Just as in the US people there seemed quietly resigned to being served this way. David told George to stop his whinging. </p>

<p>We finally get onto the bus to Santiago. 23:45: David is a majorly good sleeper!</p>

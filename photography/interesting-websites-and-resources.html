<p>This isn’t what I expected it to be.  Kost shows many, many sets of 2 and 3 photos that she believes go together.  She even looks at sequences of five or more photos. In other words, this is a chance to hear her talk about what she sees in images.  She talks about patterns, the way her eyes move, etc.</p>

<p>There is nothing technical to learn here.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPohZkGqero">second part of this tutorial</a> shows her modifying sets of photos in order to make them fit together in sets better. At around 3:08 she shows us a trick for seeing 3 images together in a sort of “secondary display” window while working on one of the images.</p>

<h1 id="exposure-compensation">Exposure Compensation</h1>

<p>Exposure Compensation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">a feature to allow the user to adjust the automatically calculated exposure</a>.  This finally makes sense to me.  Since I usually set exposure manually, I usually have no need for this control.</p>

<h1 id="can-a-composite-really-be-called-a-photograph">Can a Composite Really Be Called a Photograph?</h1>

<p>This question is asked <a href="http://www.lightstalking.com/composite-photographs/">here</a>.  Strange how the <em>name</em> we apply to a work matters so much to some people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suppose people feel like [making composite photographs] is cheating, and that would be why they devalue it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at all the contortions here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is certainly more creditable and preferable if all the original photos that make up the composite (I call them “sample” images) were taken by the photographer, himself. I don’t really consider a piece of work to be completely yours when it is merely a composite made from photos that somebody else took. If, however, you took the time to photograph all the sample images, having waited for the light to be coming in the right direction and the conditions to be met, just so that you could create something even more powerful than the samples themselves, then your photograph is as good as any made straight in camera. It would be a photograph, after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But to fairly tell you that your composite is a photograph, you will have to do it right, and do it well. I would say that any picture is just a random snapshot if it isn’t good enough to call it a photograph, so I believe composite photos demand some input of work and skill, or else I wouldn’t regard that as true photography, either.</p>

<p>This review makes the interesting observation that the “built in Neutral density is a nifty feature when you need to slow down the shutter in normal light.”</p>

<h3 id="fuji-x-t10-video-reviewhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvy3cz5wtslbq"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3CZ5wTSLBQ">Fuji X-T10 video review</a></h3>

<p>They discuss something called <em>focus point selection</em>.  It also has what they call <em>split-screen focusing</em>, which is really dual-screens showing the full image and an enlarged piece.</p>

<p>Very nice continuous shooting.</p>

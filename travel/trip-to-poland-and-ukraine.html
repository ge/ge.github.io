    <h1 class="post-title">Trip to Poland and Ukraine (April 2016)</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>In April 2016 Iris Tillman and I took a trip to Poland and Ukraine.  Iris wanted to go to Ukraine because much of her family came from there around 1900.  She also wanted to see Poland because of its long history with the Jewish people.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="website-timeline">Website timeline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The photos of the trip are now online</li>
  <li>This overview page has been written but will change over time</li>
  <li>Some pages are already fairly complete, with lots of written details, but the majority of the pages simply show photos.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="galicia">Galicia</h2>

<p>Before discussing Poland and Ukraine, we need to discuss Galicia.  The name is important because some of Iris’ family said that they had come from Galicia.  It’s hard for us to understand just what Galicia was and is.  Here is our simplified understanding based on <a href="http://www.torugg.org/History/history_of_galicia.html">this site</a> and others.</p>

<p>The name <em>Galizia</em> derives from <em>Halychyna</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…before 1370 [Galicia] was an independent and powerful medieval Ruthenian (Ukrainian) Kingdom with capital in Halych which was built by Prince Volodymyrko in 1140. Since then the name Halychyna was applied to whole land. Galician king Danylo took and ruled over Kyiv (Kiev) even. In 1264 Danylo’s son king Lev moves capital to Lviv. In 1349 Poland won a battle against Galicia and it stopped to exist as independent state for a long time until 1918 when short lived West Ukrainian Republic with capital in Lviv was proclaimed but quickly taken by Poles. Former territories of Galicia are now shared between southern Poland and Western Ukraine, with most of Galicia in Ukraine and small minor part in Poland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Galicia did exist for a time as an actual country, but now it seems to be a way to name an area on both sides of the Polish-Ukrainian border:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.zolynia.org/images/galicia-map-f.gif" alt="map" /></p>

<p>This map shows Galicia as essentially divided between Polish and Ukranian areas.</p>

<p>But look at this map:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.polishjews.org/maps/partit3.gif" alt="map" /></p>

<p>This map shows Poland at the end of the 18th century after it had been partitioned by Prussia, Austria and Russia, as explained at greater length <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland">here</a>.  If you compare the two maps (start by locating Kraków and Lviv), you’ll see that most of Galicia was in the Austrian partition, with a bit in the Russian part.</p>

<p>Finally, notice this map of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement#Territories_of_the_Pale">Pale of Settlement</a>, an area created in 1791 by Catherine the Great of Russia.  It was an area where Jews were allowed to live (they could not live <em>beyond the Pale</em>).  Its borders varied, and the also area contained cities where Jews could not live.</p>

<p><img src="https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/images/4/4d/Pale_of_Jewish_Settlement.png" alt="Pale of Settlement" /></p>

<p>Notice the town of <em>Kamenets-Podolsky</em> just to the right of the words <em>Austro-Hungary</em> and just inside the Russian area.  This means that on April 17, 2016, when we drove from Yaremche to Kamenets-Podolsky, <em>we went from former Austro-Hungarian Galicia to former Russian Podollya</em>.  This corresponds roughly to going from where Iris’ mother’s family came from to where her father’s family came from.  People walked these kinds of distances frequently in the old days.  In fact, many still seem to today.</p>

<p>Significant as this sounds, it’s a bit of a letdown to learn that the two sides of the family met in Manhattan.</p>

<h2 id="poland">Poland</h2>

<p>Poland was reassembled into a single country in 1918 at the end of WWI:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2520895.8364610723!2d16.886921860993613!3d51.90088867903189!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47009964a4640bbb%3A0x97573ca49cc55ea!2sPoland!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1465099975645" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Notice that Kraków, which was one of the capitals of Galicia (Lviv was the other capital), is in today’s Poland.</p>

<p>Our trip to Poland was arranged by <a href="https://www.roadscholar.org/find-an-adventure/18187/independent-warsaw-and-krakow-capitals-past-and-present">Roadscholar</a>, but we arrived a couple of days before the tour began so that we could explore on our own.</p>

<p>This was what Roadscholar calls an <em>independent tour</em>, so we actually didn’t do much in Warsaw with the group although we did do some exploring with subsets of the group.</p>

Disqus is a system that allows static websites like this one to have comments.  You will have to log in to disqus somehow.  I registered on disqus a long time ago because many sites use it.  For example, <a href="http://dailytarheel.com">The Daily Tar Heel</a> uses discus for its comments.  I would love for you to comment on our trip.</p>
